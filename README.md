# Coursera / Princeton Algorithms class assignments code

https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1

- [x] Week 1, Percolation, grade 100/100. To fix the backwash problem, you'd just need an extra copy of the field with a bit less connections ;-)
- [x] Week 2, Deque, grade 92/100. Randomized array iterator needs a copy of array indices to iterate correctly. Thus memory consumption is up.
- [ ] Week 3, Collinear points
- [ ] Week 4
- [ ] Week 5
- [ ] Week 6

### How to run

Make sure `algs4.jar` is in your class path, I've added it in `lib` dir. Or use `javac-algs4` and `java-algs4` to compile and run.

### Percolation

- Includes the bundlede test scenarios in `test` dir.

### Deque

- Includes `LinkedStack` and `ResizingArray` implementations provided by the course.
